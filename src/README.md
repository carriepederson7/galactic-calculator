## Galactic Calculator

#### Back-end logic for to calculate age and years left to live on a variety of planets. Project utilizes ES6 features including classes, let and const. Dependencies are managed with npm. Webpack is used to lint, bundle, and process code.9.6.19
#### By Carrie Schmid

## Description

#### The calculator will take a personâ€™s age in years and create a class that do the following:
* _Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)_
* _Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)_
* _Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)_
* _Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)_
* _Determines how many years a user has left to live on each plane, based on the age they expect to live until._
* _If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy on  each planet._
